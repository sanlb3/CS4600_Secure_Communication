Final Project : Designed a secure communication system to securely encrypt a sender’s message with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, and encrypt the AES key with the receiver’s Riverst-Shamir-Aldeman (RSA) public key. In order to read the sender’s message, the receiver will use their RSA private key to decrypt the AES key along with the message. Additionally, the system ensures data integrity of the data transmitted with a Message Authentication Code (MAC).
